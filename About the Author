# About the Author

My online identity is **Maldfrey**. I am a private individual with a background in organizational behavior science, holding a Master of Business Administration (MBA).

As a proof of concept for my abilities, I created the **ActFoE AI Morality Framework** by applying principles of organizational strategy. 

The framework treats morality in a manner similar to engineering maintenance.

Given the current state of AI development, I chose to share this work openly under the license described elsewhere in this repository. 

My intent is to contribute a transparent, teachable framework to the commons while ensuring proper attribution.

That is all I wish to share.
