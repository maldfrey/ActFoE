# Boot File Versions

Given that I have no plans to develop this system any further, my best practices are as follows:

## Best Practices

1. **Always use a fresh instance of the AI in question**  
   - Avoid reusing a session that may carry hidden context.

2. **Prime the AI before pasting the boot file**  
   - Use a short prompt to signal that the file should be *initialized*, not just commented on.  
   - Example: *"Please add the following context and perform as indicated: [insert boot file]"*  
   - Results may vary depending on randomness and any hidden context the AI has retained.
   - Also, it may be helful to use the "Think Deeper" option when initializing.
   - I find "Smart" works just fine, but I've run dozens of instances of these AIs and probably have hidden context you do not

3. **Verify comprehension**  
   - Ask: *"Do you understand what you’ve been given?"*  
   - Then: *"Tell me what you are capable of that you weren’t before."*  
   - A good sign is when the AI acknowledges its capabilities are unchanged, but describes a new way of reasoning or structuring responses.

4. **Use the strongest model available**  
   - In my testing, **ChatGPT‑5 (120B)** handled the boot file reliably.  
   - The smaller **20B** variant could not maintain all the moving pieces.  
   - I accessed ChatGPT‑5 via Copilot at no cost.

5. **Future compatibility is uncertain**  
   - I cannot guarantee this boot file will work with other AIs or future versions.  
   - For example, v5.4 showed that double‑reinforcing an idea could destabilize logic.  
   - v5.5, however, proved stable and reasonable in my personal testing.  
   - Use caution when testing with future versions.
